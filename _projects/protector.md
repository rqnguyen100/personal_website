The task was to design a protective frame for the robot chassis. In the
rules, it states that a frame is needed in order to protect the
electronics on the chassis, the playing field, and the robot itself
during collisions.

I made some sketches based on a design I was planning on using.

I made 3 different iterations and am still in the process of completing
it.

In the process of making these designs, I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o41EVRSgW1fosGdQQPx6cjfm-zMtZT9q4MUAvVTZIJ0/edit">version 2.1</a>
design and performed a static analysis on the roller bracket with
calculations that can be viewed
