This is an ongoing R&D project for Triton Robotics. The goal of this project is to create a two wheel balancing robot capable of vertical expansion through the use of linkages. A concept report was created and can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zryXNnguv9LZIG55kmAJlmXaF4ni0PF_VRLH0Zbo2e8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

Some sketches were drawn before proceeding to the 3d-modeling phase and a draft model was created

A trade study was used to determine the material for the chassis, protective frame, and chassis plating. Due to the research part of this project, extruded aluminum will be used for the chassis to determine the viability on future robots.
