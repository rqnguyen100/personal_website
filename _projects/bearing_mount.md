For the wheel module, a bearing mount is used to hold the bearing in
place to reduce friction between the axle of the motor and the wheel
hub. This bearing mount was made using an FDM 3D Printer and the goal
was to switch to metal.

Using Fusion360's CAM software, the tool paths were created. The details
are documented <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZn579FIWlVwzZdwGVc9sX75od7d7MJgE7MT9CZnqaI/edit">here</a>.
