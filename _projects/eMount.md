    Mount on Peg Board

<hr>

In order to have easy and fast access to the electronics in the robot, a
peg board was used to mount electronics.

I had to create a mount for the main control module that could easily
attach on the peg board and could hold the module, which was about 80 g.
I was handed this project from a previous team member that had been
working on it. They decided to use springs as a key feature of the mount
and the design was based on this
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5-PrIXwLcKN2rSgNOzBm-Trjf9d_D9l/view">paper</a>.
Most of the model was already designed and the springs worked fine. The
current problem with the design was that the pegs on the mount would
break.

In order to reduce the stress on each individual peg, I decided to add
more pegs on the sides of the mount and on the center. I made multiple
configurations to test different models.

It was 3D printed, but the team decided not to use a peg board due to
added complexity.
