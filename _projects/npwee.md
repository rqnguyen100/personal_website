#### <u>What I did as a PI</u>
Before my role as the lead systems engineer, I was a PI performing research and identifying solutions to TX 12: Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing. I reached out to subject matter experts to gain more knowledge.

#### <u>What I did as a Lead Systems Engineer</u>
The project my team worked on was Fiberglass Manufacturing using Lunar Regolith. 

As the lead systems engineer, I worked with the PI and chief scientist to create a gantt chart for the project, idenified skill sets that would be needed, and communicated with the engineers what requirements the science team wanted.

#### <u>Result</u>
The end result of this project was a proposal and a New Technology Report that can be viewed in the documentation page.
