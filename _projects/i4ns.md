#### <u>What I did</u>
<li>Utilized the LEAN startup methodology to develop a minimum value product and iteratively refined it based on beneficiary feedback to develop a solution for the US Marine Corp</li>
<li>Interviewed 13 beneficiaries and visited 2 military bases to learn more about the end user experience and used the feedback to update the minimum value product</li>
<li>Constructed a mission model canvas and value proposition canvas to identify beneficiaries, how value can be provided to them, product market fit, and the steps required for deployment</li>
