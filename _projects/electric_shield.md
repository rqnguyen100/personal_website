<hr>

During the RoboMaster competition, flying projectiles will hit the robot. As a result, electronic covers were designed to protect the mounted electronics.

The cover for the electronics on the turret follows the contour of the main plate and is mounted using cube nuts. Slots were added to make room for wiring.

The cover for the electronics on the chassis fits over the side plates on the chassis. It is primarily mounted using a standoff and knob screw. The sides of the 3D printed part will be velcro-ed to the aluminum square tubing for extra stability. A slot of cut to allow space of wires.
