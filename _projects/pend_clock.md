I was tasked with creating the design for a pendulum clock and
fabricating it. The pendulum clock uses an escapement mechanism, where
the escapement wheel pushes the pallets of the pendulum to oscillate it.

The photo used as the design of the clock pendulum was a pikachu. The
dimensions for the escapement wheel and the prongs for the pendulum were
provided.

After designing the pendulum, calculations were done to determine the
period of oscillation. Two methods were used: point-mass and rigid-body.
They can be viewed

The pendulum clock was assembled using a variety of manufacturing
processes. Most of the parts were laser cut and then drilled using a
drill press. The video of the clock in action can be viewed
