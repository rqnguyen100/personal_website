#### <u>What I did</u>
<li>Wrote a C++ program for balancing a robot using a PID controller and sensor fusion on pitch and velocity</li>
<li>Made a model of the system by solving for its transfer function and reverse-engineering the physical model</li>
<li>Used MATLAB to view the root locus plot and step response to tune PIDs by checking the transient behavior</li>
