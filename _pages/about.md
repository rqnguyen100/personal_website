Hello! My name is Roger Nguyen and I'm a student from the University of California San Diego. 

My major is Mechanical Engineering with a Specialization in Controls and Robotics.

My current interest is the field of Mechatronics. I'm passionate about learning about mechanical and electrical systems, as well as, programming.

In my free time, I like to read, weightlift, play table tennis, and do martial arts. I'm currently a 2nd Dan black belt in Taekwondo.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
